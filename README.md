# Synthetic_Images_GAN
Using PyTorch to generate new synthetic images from a dataset of given images.
PyTorch to create the Generator and Discriminator Networks and training the model.
Feeding the model a dataset of images from which it generates new synthetic images.
One can tune the model for better accuracy by changing the number of epochs and also view the generation of image from noise and its development with each epoch.
